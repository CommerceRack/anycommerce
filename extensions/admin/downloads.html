	<h2>First Time Installation Notes</h2>
	
	<div>
	
		<p>Before installing any of the applications above you should consider the following:</p>
		
		<h3>.Net Framework Required</h3>
		<p class='hint'>
		All applications require the Windows Installer 3.1, and Microsoft .NET 3.5 sp1 framework to be installed for proper operation.
		Please use the links to download:</p>
		<ul class='marginBottom'>
			<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=5A58B56F-60B6-4412-95B9-54D056D6F9F4&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Windows Installer 4.5</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=AB99342F-5D1A-413D-8319-81DA479AB0D7&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Microsoft .Net 3.5 sp1 Download Site</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Network Database Installation</h3>
		<p class='hint'>Installation documentation can be found: 
		<ul>
			<li><span class='lookLikeLink' data-docid='50491' data-app-click='admin_support|showHelpDocInDialog'>Webdoc #50491</span>.
			<div class='hint'>Warning: Network Database installations are difficult multi-step processes with lots of room for mistakes. We encourage companies who do not employ a fulltime database administrator (which is different than a "Tech Guy") to consult with our <a href="#/biz/support/index.cgi?VERB=CALENDAR&amp;CLASS=GEEK" title="/biz/support/index.cgi?VERB=CALENDAR&amp;CLASS=GEEK" target="_blank">Geek Services</a> to deploy your database. In order to speed up the installation appointment, please view our <span class='lookLikeLink' data-docid='51357' data-app-click='admin_support|showHelpDocInDialog'>Webdoc #51357</span> prior to your appointment.</div>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h3>Multi-Site Considerations</h3>
		<p class='hint'>
		Only one database may be active per account. If you have multiple sites
		or remote users you will need to use a VPN solution to connect them.<br />
		<a href="#/biz/support/index.cgi?VERB=CALENDAR&amp;CLASS=GEEK" title="/biz/support/index.cgi?VERB=CALENDAR&amp;CLASS=GEEK" target="_blank">Zoovy Geek Services</a> 
		can assist you with multi-site VPN deployments.
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>Enterprise Support</h3>
		<p class='hint'>Zoovy provides an enhanced level of support for our larger clients who are more sensitive to service disruptions.  Enterprise support is also suitable for clients who need specific customizations made to their software version. Enterprise support also offers scheduled upgrades on weekends and off-business hours to minimize potential disruption to business operations. Please contact billing@zoovy.com to determine eligibility for this service.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Supported Operating Systems: </h3>
		<p class='hint'>
		Windows Vista sp2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003 r2, Windows 8; Windows Server 2008, 2013.
		Requires .NET Framework 3.0. 
		<br />
		64 Bit Considerations: Order Manager will run correctly on Vista/Windows 7 64 Bit Operating System.
		Other applications such as Quickbooks and Endicia will not integrate properly. 
		In addition various peripherals such as many models of HP Printers are known to have issues
		and will cause the Order Manager software to become unstable.
