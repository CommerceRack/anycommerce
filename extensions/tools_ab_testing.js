/*
This is a beta of an AB testing plugin.  The code in init handles local storing and assigning of groupings.

Usage of the plugin is intended as follows:

1) Add feature keys to vars.groupings, along with the "length" (number of groups possible
2) Add renderFormats, actions, utilities, or other AB testable features.  Use the grouping assignments as part of a switch statement to determine functionality
3) Analyze Data

TODO:
Add support for data-mining- hooks for google analytics tracking
