What follows is the Pirate Code. It's meant as a guideline and there are exceptions, but as a general rule of thumb, these should be obeyed. These apply to the admin app.


Avoid using all uppercase. anywhere. always. It looks bad. It's hard to read.

Avoid using ID's.
	Keep in mind that most pieces of the user inteface have the potential to be opened multiple times at once.
	ID's will cause inconsistent behavior if you use them.



Forms
if you use this format for a form input, you'll maintain consistency:

for inputs that are not checkbox or radio buttons:
<label>
	<span>Prompt only has first letter uppercased and no colon</span>
	<input type='something'>
	<span class='toolTip' title="This is my tool tip">?</span>
</label>

for radio and checkboxes
<label>
	<input type='something'>
	Prompt only has first letter uppercased and no colon
	<span class='toolTip' title="This is my tool tip">?</span>
</label>


If your form is divided into parts, use fieldsets to divide each section. Use a legend within each fieldset to indicate what is to follow.
Keep your legends fairly short.
Use tooltips as much as necessary. format as:  <span class='toolTip' title="This is the actual tip.">?</span>
Keep inline help to a minimum. format as: <span class='hint'>some hint</span>

Add a class 'labelsAsBreaks' on the form to give each label a block status.



Buttons:
Upper case the first letter of each word.
if you have several buttons in a horizontal row and 1 button is delete or remove, always put it on the left.
in general, if you have a set of buttons and some display conditionally, group the non-conditional together (typically on the right) so they're aligned and not moving around.


Titles and Legends:
Uppercase the first letter of each word.
