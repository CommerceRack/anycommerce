These are some general style guidelines to follow when building/editing for our admin app.



avoid using all uppercase. anywhere. always.
avoid using ID's. Keep in mind that most pieces of the user inteface have the potential to be opened multiple times at once. ID's will cause inconsistent behavior if you use them.


Forms:
if you use this format for a form input, you'll maintain consistency:

<label>
	<span>Prompt only has first letter uppercased and no semi colon</span>
	<input type='something'>
	<span class='toolTip' title="This is my tool tip">?</span>
</label>

If your form is divided into parts, use fieldsets to divide each section. Use a legend within each fieldset to indicate what is to follow.
Keep your legends fairly short.
Keep inline help to a minimum.
Use tooltips as much as necessary.

Add a class 'labelsAsBreaks' on the form to give each label a block status.



Buttons:
Upper case the first letter of each word.
if you have several buttons in a horizontal row and 1 button is delete or remove, always put it on the left.

Titles and Legends:
Uppercase the first letter of each word.
