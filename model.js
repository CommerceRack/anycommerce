/*

Our goal is to have a very limited number of 'models' out there.
More controllers may exist than models.
More Extensions will exist than controllers.
view files will be distributed en-masse.

The model is primarily used only for sending and receiving data requests.
The model is also responsible for loading extensions (essentially a request with a fixed callback).
It then saves that data/extension into the control obj.
most code for display is in the 'view', which may be a TOXML file.
some display code may be present in the renderFormat portion of the control.
The view and the model should never speak to each other directly... other than maybe a button in the view executing app.model.dispatchThis().

There are two types of data being dealt with:
1. ajax request (referred to as request from here forward) for store data, such as product info, product lists, merchant info, etc.
2. extensions loaded as part of control object instantiation or on the fly as needed.

Some high level error handling occurs as part of the model, mostly for ISE's.
The rest is in the controller or extension. The model will execute callbacks.CALLBACKID.onError(d,uuid)
 -> d is the data object returned by the server. one of the few cases the raw response is returned.


execute the zoovyModel function from within the controller. ex:  app.model = zoovyModel();
 -> this will return an object into the app.model namespace. ex: app.model.dispatchThis()


There are currently three dispatch queues. (Q or DQ) which reside in app.q.
Each queue can be filled with several requests, then dispatched all at once.
that'll piggyback several dispatches on one request, which is considerably more efficient
than several requests.

q.passive - should only be used for requests with no callbacks or for requests that should never get cancelled by another, but are not strictly necessary.
For instance, if you wanted to retrieve product data for page
2 and 3 when the user is on page 1, you'd use passive. No action occurs as a results of getting this data.
Or if you have dispatches occur during your app init but are concerned they could get over-written by the immutable q (such as requests for site nav that you don't want nukd if the user is coming in to the app for checkout) then use passive.
the passive q requests are never aborted.

q.mutable - this is the bulk of your calls. Getting information and then doing something with it (executed from the callback). It is called mutable
because it can be muted. aka aborted. if an immutable request is sent, it will cancel all mutable requests. Likewise, the app.model.abortQ() function
will abort all mutable requests.  Use this when the users direction changes (they click page 1, then quickly click page 2 - you'd want to cancel the requests for 
page 1 so their callbacks are not executed).

q.immutable - use this sparingly, for 'mission critical' requests, such as add to cart, update cart and any requests during checkout.  Only 1 immutable request will fire at a time.
if any mutable requests are in process, they're cancelled. if an immutable request is in process and another request comes in (mutable or immutable), 
the secondary request is delayed till the first is done.


in some cases, you may use a mutable request for an add to cart so that the user can push it and move on with their experience. That's ok.
however, it is highly recommended that you only use the immutable q for checkout.

even though multiple dispatches can occur at the same time, it's still in your interest to pack the queue and dispatch at once.
it'll be faster with fewer dispatches.


app.globalAjax.overrideAttempts - keeps track of how many times a dispatch has attempted while another is in progress.
app.globalAjax.lastDispatch - keeps track of when the last dispatch occurs. Not currently used for much, but could allow for some auto-passive dispatches when idle.

	addDispatchToQ
	
	The function returns false if the dispatch was not added to q or the uuid if it was.  
	uuid is returned so that it can be passed into other dispatches if needed.
	
	dispatch is a json object.
	exactly what gets passed in depends on the type of request being made.
	each dispatch will automatically get assigned the following, if not passed in:
	 -> uuid: Universal unique identifier. each request needs a unique id. best practice is to NOT pass one and to let this function generate one.
	 -> attempts: increments the number of attempts made on dispatch. will get set to zero if not set. 
	 -> status: dispatches are not deleted from the queue. instead, a status is set (such as completed). 
	
	Depending on the command, multiple params may be required. However to keep this function light, only _cmd is validated.
	
	In most cases, the following _rtag items should be set:
	_rtag.callback -> a reference to an item in the control object that gets executed on successful request (response may include errors)
	_rtag.datapointer -> this is where in app.data the information returned will be saved to. 
	ex: datapointer:appProductGet|SKU would put product data into app.data['appProductGet|SKU']
	
	if no datapointer is passed, no data is returned in an accessable location for manipulation.
	 -> the only time the actual response is passed back to the control is if an error was present.

*	typically, there will be 'one extension to bind them all'. this extension is less-self-contained. 
	It'll include dependencies and the list of templates used.

namespace - the extension is saved to app.ext.namespace and would be 'called' using that name. (app.ext.namespace.calls.somecall.init()
extension - the filename. full path.
callback - a function to be executed once the extension is done loading.

the 'convertSessionToOrder' namespace is reserved for checkout. only 1 checkout extension can be loaded at a time.
use a unique naming convention for any custom extensions, such as username_someusefulhint (ex: cubworld_jerseybuilder)

The ajax request itself (fetchExtension) was originally in the addExtension function in the loop.  This caused issues.
only one extension was getting loaded, but it got loaded for each iteration in the loop. even with async turned off.
