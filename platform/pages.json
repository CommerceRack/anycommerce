Aside from down allergies, some consumers want the luxury of down but a lower price point. For those consumers we have a collection of luxury down alternatives to choose from.\n\n\nIf you think you have allergy issues or are buying bedding for your family or house guests we recommend PrimaLoft, which is a luxury Down Alternative filling material. Not only does PrimaLoft mimic feel of down filling but it keeps a warmth level equivalent to a 550-600 fill power white goose down. PrimaLoft also has a permanent antimicrobial treatment in the fibers that will not wash out. PrimaLoft is used in bed pillows, comforters, mattress pads, pillow forms and on occasion fiber beds (soft beds)."

Blankets typically feature smaller quilted boxes that range from 8 inches to 10 inches. \n\n* Comforters are usually thicker then blankets with about double the filling material used and typically larger boxes (12 to 16 inches). Throws are the most like blankets with the biggest difference being size - throws are typically used for the couch or casual wrapping up while resting. \n\n* Blankets and throws are generally easy care home machine washable and dryable. Comforters due to their size sometimes require a commercial size washing machine. Often blankets and throws carried in stores are imported from China - our collection below is primarily made in the USA (unless noted as such).",

      "description" : "== Featherbeds Versus Mattress Pads - How To Choose? ==\n\n\nA feather bed is a bedding item used on top of your mattress and is filled with a blend of down and feathers. Some feather beds feature a top layer whether it is down topped or polyester pillow topped. Feather beds generally are 3 to 5 inches in height and feature baffle box chambers to keep the fill separated and easier to fluff and maintain.\n\n\nA mattress pad is generally used over your mattress and features a stretchable skirt or sometimes anchor bands to keep it in place. Typically mattress pads are no thicker than one inch. Mattress pads also can feature special treatments such as a water resistant layer.\n\n\nMattress pads protect your mattress while feather beds or fiber beds add fluffy comfort.\n\n\nA feather bed and a mattress pad can be used together based on the size of the mattress pad skirt or anchor bands. The average consumer mattress is approximately 12 inches in height. So if you have a feather bed on top of your mattress your mattress pad can be applied on top of the feather bed if it has a skirt that is approximately 16 inches or more in height. If your mattress pad has a smaller skirt you can place it over your mattress and below your feather bed. As another option if you have a down topped feather bed you might not want to interfere with the softness of the down material and keep your mattress pad below your feather bed. If you have a dog, baby or generally spill items in your bed frequently you might want to opt to keep a water resistant mattress pad on top of your feather bed. Generally feather beds are not machine washable due to their size and should be spot cleaned. We do recommend adding a feather bed protector when buying a feather bed or even to cover an older feather bed and extend its life."

The larger the box size the higher the fill power or more filling is needed to keep the square fluffy. Comforters are generally best suited for fall/winter usage as they tend to be better in heat retention when compared to a blanket.\n\n\nA blanket is usually filled with down or down alternative and features smaller stitched boxes ranging in size from 4 to 6 inches. Blankets are typically larger than comforters as they are meant to be tucked under the mattress for a hotel look. Blankets frequently have a decorative element such as satin binding or a self flange. Blankets are a great summer weight bedding option. They can be paired with a comforter in winter for extra warmth. Most blankets are machine washable. "

      "description" : "== Feathers Versus Down ==\n\n\nDown is the light fluffy coating beneath the feathers of ducks and geese. Each down cluster is made from thousands of tiny fibers, like little cotton balls between the bird's skin and feathers. Mother Nature created down to keep water fowl dry and warm when they swim around in the water. One down comforter provides the warmth and temperature control of 14 wool blankets, but because of down's natural ability to pull moisture away from the skin you never wake up hot and clammy in the middle of the night.\n\n\nHigh quality down comes only from ducks and geese. Chickens and other birds do not produce down because they do not spend a significant portion of their lives in the water. 85% of the world's production of down and feathers comes from Asia; the remaining 15% is generally produced in Eastern Europe. Farmers who raise ducks and geese for their meat sell the unprocessed feathers and down to processing companies around the world, so no usable part of the bird is wasted.\n\n\nDown clusters are naturally very durable, it is not uncommon for people to use a down bedding product for a dozen years or more before replacing it. Down is also naturally flame retardant, making it an excellent choice for safe sleeping.\n\n\nDown and feathers come in various shades ranging from pure white to black speckled gray. There is a premium on pure white down and feathers because of their ability to visually blend better when filled into white bedding products, but the color does not affect the down's loft or warmth. As consumers taste for lighter bird meat increases, white down and feathers are becoming more abundant."

As a result - DOWNLITE - one of the 2-3 preferred vendors at the time shipped a combination of pillows, comforters, and mattress pads to approximately one thousand properties worldwide.\n\n\nBecause each property owner could buy slightly different - it is hard to say for sure, what each hotel purchased and uses because we shipped mainly to their distribution centers. The safest thing to do for finding an item you enjoyed, is to write down or record the information on the law tag attached to a product and contact us for more information. In some cases the description on the law tag will match one of the items listed below directly. In other cases you may not have had a chance to written down the info or lost it and we can try to manually look it up one by one to help you out.\n\n\nIn terms of pillows - 90% of the property owners used our Medium Density EnviroLoft pillow, followed by a split of those using either the 5/95 feather pillow or the MicroLoft pillow. In very few cases did they use an 'all down pillow' - of course if you would like that option they are available for sale as well.\n\n\nMost properties used our Ultra Plush pad - a very nice thick easy care pad.\n\n\nFor comforters and blankets almost 100% of the properties used our EnviroLoft down alternative filling in either the regular or the lightweight options (we suggest the lightweight option when pairing with a duvet cover to minimize weight).",

Silk down bedding is generally higher maintenance and requires dry cleaning for the silk. Most silk bedding products are not made with machine washable grade silk fabric. Due to the fine nature of silk yarn most silk down bedding comes in higher thread count ranges from 400 and up. Most silk bed pillows feature a removable silk protector. To wash the pillow you would remove the outer protector. You could then machine wash your pillow and send the protector to a dry cleaner. This is a much cheaper option than sending the whole pillow to the dry cleaner (which can run about $20 to $30 for a cleaning)."

      "description" : "Buying bedding online can be daunting because you can't touch the items. As the leading supplier of bedding to the best stores, hotels, resorts and cruise lines - we know how to keep you comfortable. \n\nMany common questions are answered below - you can also visit our sleeping blog at NocJournal.com or call us for more advice.\n\n== Fill Power Information ==\n* Often times the fill power of an item can be confused as a barometer for quality.\n* Fill power simply measures how fluffy the down is and makes the most sense when comparing comforters.\n* Most consumers love cloud lift soft bedding - and to get that experience a higher fill power is needed.\n* For Pillows a fill power of 550 - 600 is perfectly fine\n* For comforters a fill power of 600-800 is amazing (the higher the number the more cloud like you will feel\n\n== Pillow Tips ==\nPillows are sold by density level - regardless of filling material.\nWhite Goose Down is considered the gold standard closely followed by PrimaLoft which is our Luxury Down Alternative\n* If you sleep on your side (50% of us do) then choose a firmer density pillow.\n* If you sleep on your back (25% of us do) then choose a medium density pillow.\n* If you sleep face down or on your stomach (25% of us do) - then choose a soft density pillow.\n\n100% of DOWNLITE's pillows are made in the USA of Hypoallergenic materials.\n\nMost pillows are machine washable & dryable (except silk and rayon).\n\nPillows can last 1-25 years based on the fillings, usage and care. Polyester pillows last 1-2 years usually versus down and feather pillows which can last 5-25 years.\n\nFluff Your pillows in the dryer on high heat once a month for 15 minutes to keep them fluffy, fresh and in good shape.\n\n== Comforter Tips ==\n* We also suggest buying the biggest size you can to allow for less tug of war with the covers\n* Most comforters can be machine washed and dried in a commercial laundry mat\n* Try using a duvet to add color and protection to a comforter (duvet size should be within plus or minus two inches of the comforter dimensions).\n* Fills can shift in baffle box constructions - so look for PermaBaffle design comforters or sewn thru constructions.\n\n\n== Feather Bed Tips ==\n* 90% of all our feather beds are made in the USA.\n* Feather beds are too large to wash - so spot care paired with a protector works best.\n* Adding a mattress pad on a featherbed is a great way to limit any feather poking and extend usage.\n* Fluff you feather bed daily or every other day for optimum softness.\n\n\n== Sheeting, Duvets & Fine Linens ==\n* We suggest Tencel Lyocell for fabrics which is really a miracle material with a soft to the touch hand, excellent moisture wicking and relatively easy care.\n* Tencel Lyocell comes from sustainably grown Eucalyptus trees and is processed in a very eco efficient manner.\n* Don't wash sheets, duvet covers or fine linens with towels.\n\n\n== Fabrics & Thread Counts ==\n* Most of us have been conditioned to assume higher thread counts means a better product - this is not always the case.\n* We prefer Supima Cotton when available for it's long staple fibers (this means a more durable and silky product).\n* Higher thread counts mean a more dense fabric - which means  a stiffer fabric (generally we limit our fabrics to 500 TC or lower with most in the 300-400 range).\n* The weave and finishing of fabric can greatly impact it's hand (Which greatly impacts german fabrics which typically have the best hand but a relatively lower thread count due to amazing finishing).\n* DOWNLITE does not add FR (Flame Retardent) treatments to it's fabrics.\n* Wrinkle resistant fabric is usually chemically treated with an agent. DOWNLITE seldom uses these finishes for it's bedding (if an agent or finish was applied we would clearly mention it on the product information).\n* The finest cotton in the world is a German Batiste - very light weight and made with long staple cotton."

      "description" : "== Comforter Or Duvet Insert - Does It Matter? ==\n\n\nMost American consumers call down filled top of bed products a comforter. When abroad or even in the hospitality industry a comforter is called a duvet. So when searching for a comforter you will likely see it on our web site referenced as a comforter. To most American consumers a duvet is the decorative protector used in combination with a comforter. A duvet is a comforter protector that covers a comforter and is closed via buttons, zipper or an envelope type closure. When it comes time to launder the bedding, the duvet can easily be removed for cleaning and the comforter has to be washed less."
