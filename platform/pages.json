Pete Hassen, a Blackhawks spokesman, said &amp;quot;Chelsea Dagger&amp;quot; was chosen as the team's goal song from a narrowed-down pool of six candidates before the preseason.  Blur's &amp;quot;Song 2,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Tick Tick Boom&amp;quot; by the Hives and the Ting Tings' &amp;quot;Keep Your Head&amp;quot; are among the others that were considered.  The reaction to &amp;quot;Chelsea Dagger&amp;quot; from fans was mixed at first, but Hassen watched as fans warmed to it.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;\n&amp;quot;We noticed about two months into the season that people were doing their own dance to it,&amp;quot; Hassen said. &amp;quot;And now you're seeing as the team is taking off, the song is really taking off.&amp;quot;Need proof? Hassen said Cubs catcher Koyie Hill, who was at Monday night's playoff game with some other Cubs, sent a text informing him that he and his teammates couldn't stop humming it.  During the regular season, Jonathan Toews, Patrick Kane and Patrick Sharp had more personalized songs that played after they scored.The Scorpions' 1984 hit &amp;quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&amp;quot; played whenever Kane scored, while Toews celebrated to the tune of &amp;quot;Johnny B. Goode&amp;quot; by Chuck Berry and Sharp to ZZ Top's &amp;quot;Sharp Dressed Man.&amp;quot;\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;\nFor the playoffs it's been all &amp;quot;Chelsea Dagger&amp;quot; -- with its bouncy hook and signature &amp;quot;duh duh duhs&amp;quot; that fans have been humming, shouting and chanting as they file out of the United Center after a Blackhawks win.Lifelong Hawks fan Kasia Chalko said she has a &amp;quot;Pavlovian response&amp;quot; whenever she hears &amp;quot;Chelsea Dagger.&amp;quot;  Upon hearing it, she gets the sense that something great just happened -- even when it's just the Amstel Light commercial.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;\n&amp;quot;Sometimes when I'm watching the game at home and the Blackhawks score, I'll play it on my iPod,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I actually played it this morning as I was getting ready to leave my house because [Monday] night's win was so big.&amp;quot;During the White Sox' championship series in 2005, Journey's &amp;quot;Don't Stop Believing&amp;quot; became a staple at U.S. Cellular Field. So is &amp;quot;Chelsea Dagger&amp;quot; the Hawks' answer?  &amp;quot;Music tends to play a huge part in every game,&amp;quot; Hassen said. &amp;quot;I don't think you go into a year thinking, 'We're going to have a signature song.' It just kind of happens.&amp;quot;\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;\n&amp;quot;For the White Sox, I think 'Don't Stop Believing' was a little more themed. This is just kind of a feel-good song. There's no lyrics [in 'Chelsea Dagger'] that have any meaning. It's just the perfect call and response after a goal.&amp;quot;  Hassen wasn't sure whether the team will keep &amp;quot;Chelsea Dagger&amp;quot; next season.  &amp;quot;You can't really say that it's going to stay,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But when things work, why mess with it?&amp;quot;\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;\nKevin Allen is a co-author of the Sports Pros(e) blog at suntimes.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</iframe></center>"

      "description" : "<h1><font color=\"#990000\">Christmas Ordering Deadlines For U.S. Shipments</font></h1>\n\n<p>Please follow the ordering dated below to ensure your gifts arrive by December 24th. Shipping options apply to in-stock items shipped to a physical address within the U.S.A.</p>\n\n\n<p>All of us at BlackhawksShop.com appreciate your business. We are working hard to make sure that your holiday order arrives on time. Here are a few tips to help ease the stress of online holiday shopping. </p>\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li style=\"padding-bottom: 8px;\"><b>Order early: </b>The sooner you place your order, the more time you have to allow for the shipment to arrive. Inventory stock status changes rapidly during the busy holiday season so you should allow time for possible back orders or product shortages. </li>\n\n\t<li style=\"padding-bottom: 8px;\"><b>Watch for your package: </b>During the holiday season we see a sharp increase in theft of packages after delivery. Due to the volume of packages we send, we are not able to require a signature for the package unless you specifically request it. It is best to have your package sent to work, a trusted neighbor, or any address where someone will be present at the time of delivery. Shipping insurance (nor our company) cover theft after the point of delivery.</li>\n\n\t<li style=\"padding-bottom: 8px;\"><b>Inspect for damage: </b>During the busy holiday period the likelihood of shipping damage increases because of the massive volume carried by shipping companies. Please make a quick inspection of your package and check for damage when it arrives. Notify us right away if you see any damage.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Last Day to Order Domestic by 2pm (Chicago Time)</h2>\n\n<table width=\"528\" height=\"71\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" class=\"zborder\" style=\"margin: 5px 0pt 10px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n\t<td width=\"20%\" align=\"center\" class=\"ztable_head\">Standard (USPS)</td>\n\t<td width=\"20%\" align=\"center\" class=\"ztable_head\">Priority (USPS)</td>\n\t<td width=\"20%\" align=\"center\" class=\"ztable_head\">Ground (UPS)</td>\n\t<td width=\"20%\" align=\"center\" class=\"ztable_head\">2nd Day (UPS)</td>\n\t<td width=\"20%\" align=\"center\" class=\"ztable_head\">Next Day (UPS)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td align=\"center\" class=\"ztable_row\">Sat 12/16</td>\n\t<td align=\"center\" class=\"ztable_row\">Weds 12/21</td>\n\t<td align=\"center\" class=\"ztable_row\">Tues 12/20</td>\n\t<td align=\"center\" class=\"ztable_row\">Thurs 12/22</td>\n\t<td align=\"center\" class=\"ztable_row\">Fri 12/22</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Il.
